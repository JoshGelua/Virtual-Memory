Instructions for how to run it on teach.cs machines:
The following commands will produce the output required for each address trace file
and store it in:
simpleloop.txt for addr-simpleloop.ref
blocked.txt for addr-blocked.ref
matmul.txt for addr-matmul.ref

Commands:
python3 analysis.py addr-simpleloop.ref > simpleloop.txt
python3 analysis.py addr-blocked.ref > blocked.txt
python3 analysis.py addr-matmul.ref > matmul.txt

Note: For use in other trace files simply replace trace file use and pipe
the output into a text file with a name of your choosing.
E.g. : python3 analysis.py new_trace_file.ref > new_trace_file.txt


For addr-simpleloop.ref:

Number of instruction pages = 120406
Number of load pages = 50090
Number of store pages = 10063
Number of modify pages = 10006


For addr-blocked.ref:

Number of instruction pages = 52931708
Number of load pages = 21578985
Number of store pages = 2482955
Number of modify pages = 1091709


For addr-matmul.ref:

Number of instruction pages = 47473890
Number of load pages = 21491381
Number of store pages = 1180742
Number of modify pages = 1060125


The instruction page that is accessed the most is 0x0108000.
The part of the code from the program that might be stored in this page could be the instruction
as to what exact operation to perform with the program counter as it is the variable that will
be accessed the most. Alternatively, it could also be the instruction for translation of a page
table to get to the correct memory address for an operation.

The data page that is accessed the most is 0xffefff000
The variable/data from the program that might be stored in this page could be program counter as 
the program counter is accessed multiple times throughout a program, more so than any other
variables. Alternatively, the variable being accessed could also be the main paging directory table
as it is used for translation of the virtual address to the physical address.
